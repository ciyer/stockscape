# Stockscape

A repository of tools for analyzing stock prices using data from [Robert Shiller](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.xls) and the theoretical framework constructed by [Brad DeLong](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2014/08/under-what-circumstances-should-you-worry-that-the-stock-market-is-too-high-the-honest-broker-for-the-week-of-august-16.html), which builds on Shiller's ideas.
